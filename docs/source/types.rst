Types
=====

Every value in MSC has a type. The type determines what the value represents, what operations can be performed on it, and what methods are available. So far we have used types like ``Int``, ``String``, and ``Player`` without much explanation. This chapter explores how types work in detail and introduces user-defined types, which allow you to create your own.

What is a Type?
---------------

A type is a classification that defines what a value can do. When you write ``@define Int count = 5``, you are telling MSC that ``count`` holds integer values and can be used with operations like ``+``, ``-``, and ``*``. When you write ``@define Player p = Player("Ajdj123321")``, you are telling MSC that ``p`` holds a reference to a player and can use methods like ``getName()`` and ``getHealth()``.

Types serve three purposes:

1. **Safety**: MSC can catch errors before your script runs. If you try to call ``getName()`` on an integer, MSC knows that doesn't make sense and reports an error.

2. **Documentation**: Types make code easier to understand. Seeing ``Player target`` tells you what kind of value to expect, even without reading the rest of the script.

3. **Organization**: Complex types group related data and behavior together. A ``Player`` bundles a name, position, health, inventory, and dozens of methods into a single value.

Built-in Types
--------------

MSC provides two categories of built-in types: primitive types for basic values, and complex types for interacting with the Minecraft world.

Primitive Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Primitive types represent simple values. They are covered in detail in :ref:`Variables <variables>`, but here is a quick summary:

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 40 40
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Type
      - Description
      - Example Literals
    * - ``String``
      - Text
      - ``"Hello"``, ``"Score: {{x}}"``
    * - ``Int``
      - Whole number (-2 billion to 2 billion)
      - ``42``, ``-7``, ``0``
    * - ``Long``
      - Large whole number
      - ``100L``, ``9999999999L``
    * - ``Float``
      - Decimal number
      - ``3.14``, ``-0.5``
    * - ``Double``
      - Precise decimal number
      - ``3.14159D``, ``1.0D``
    * - ``Boolean``
      - True or false
      - ``true``, ``false``

Primitive types have constructors for converting between types:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Convert a String to an Int
    @define Int x = Int("42")
    # Convert an Int to a String
    @define String s = String(100)
    # Convert an Int to a Double
    @define Double d = Double(5)
    @player {{x}}, {{s}}, {{d}}

.. code-block:: output

    42, 100, 5.0

Complex Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Complex types represent objects in the Minecraft world. Unlike primitives, they are created using constructors and provide methods for interacting with their data.

.. list-table::
    :widths: 20 80
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Type
      - Description
    * - ``Player``
      - A Minecraft player. Provides access to name, position, health, inventory, and more.
    * - ``Entity``
      - Any Minecraft entity (mobs, armor stands, arrows, etc.).
    * - ``Block``
      - A block in the world at specific coordinates.
    * - ``Item``
      - An item stack with a type and amount.
    * - ``Location``
      - A position with decimal coordinates (x, y, z) and a world.
    * - ``BlockLocation``
      - A position with integer coordinates aligned to the block grid.
    * - ``Position``
      - A Location with yaw and pitch (direction the entity is facing).
    * - ``Region``
      - A WorldGuard region or a custom-defined area.
    * - ``Vector3``
      - A 3D vector of Doubles (x, y, z).
    * - ``BlockVector3``
      - A 3D vector of Ints aligned to the block grid.
    * - ``Vector2``
      - A 2D vector of Doubles (x, z).
    * - ``BlockVector2``
      - A 2D vector of Ints on the XZ plane.

For a complete reference of constructors and methods for each type, see :ref:`Built-in Types <appendix_built_in_types>`.

Constructors
------------

A constructor creates a new instance of a type. Constructors are called by writing the type name followed by arguments in parentheses:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Create a Player from their username
    @define Player p = Player("Ajdj123321")
    # Create a Block from coordinates and world name
    @define Block b = Block(100, 64, -200, "Theta")
    # Create a Location with precise decimal coordinates
    @define Location loc = Location(100.5D, 64.0D, -200.5D, "Theta")

Each type has specific constructors that accept different arguments. For example, ``Player`` can be constructed from a name, a UUID, or coordinates:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Find player by their current username
    @define Player p1 = Player("Ajdj123321")
    # Find player by their UUID (works even if they changed their name or are offline)
    @define Player p2 = Player("e62bfa1e-f625-4ad3-9403-7e7f8e14d0f1")
    # Find a player standing at specific coordinates
    @define Player p3 = Player(100, 64, -200, "Theta")

The first finds a player by name, the second by UUID, and the third finds a player at specific coordinates. If no matching player exists or is online, the constructor returns ``null``.

Constructors that might fail (like ``Player`` for an offline player or ``Block`` for an unloaded chunk) may return ``null``. Always check for null before using the result:

.. code-block:: msc

    @define Player target = Player("someone")
    @if target != null
        @player Found {{target.getName()}}!
    @else
        @player That player is not online.
    @fi

.. code-block:: output

    That player is not online.

Methods
-------

Methods are functions that belong to a type. They are called using dot notation on a value:

.. code-block:: msc

    @define Player p = Player("Ajdj123321")
    @player Name: {{p.getName()}}
    @player Health: {{p.getHealth()}}
    @player World: {{p.getWorld()}}

.. code-block:: output

    Name: Ajdj123321
    Health: 20.0
    World: Theta

Methods can take arguments:

.. code-block:: msc

    @define Block b = Block(100, 64, -200, "Theta")
    # Get the block one position above this one
    @define Block above = b.getRelative(0, 1, 0)
    @player Block above: {{above.getBlockType()}}

.. code-block:: output

    Block above: AIR

Some methods modify the object (these typically return ``Void``):

.. code-block:: msc

    # Heal the player to full health
    @var player.setHealth(20.0D)
    # Close any open inventory screen
    @var player.closeInventory()

Others return a value that can be used in expressions:

.. code-block:: msc

    @if player.getHealth() < 10.0D
        @player &cYou're low on health!
    @fi

Methods can be chained when each method returns a value:

.. code-block:: msc

    @player {{"  hello world  ".trim().toUpperCase()}}

.. code-block:: output

    HELLO WORLD

Working with Built-in Types
---------------------------

Here are practical examples of working with the most commonly used types.

.. admonition:: Technical Detail
   :class: technical-detail

   A full list of all built-in types, their constructors, and methods can be found in :ref:`Built-in Types <appendix_built_in_types>`. These examples cover only a subset of the available functionality for illustrative purposes.

Player
^^^^^^

The ``Player`` type provides access to nearly everything about a player:

.. code-block:: msc

    @player Name: {{player.getName()}}
    @player Position: {{player.getX()}}, {{player.getY()}}, {{player.getZ()}}
    @player Health: {{player.getHealth()}} / {{player.getMaxHealth()}}
    @player Is sneaking? {{player.isSneaking()}}

.. code-block:: output

    Name: Ajdj123321
    Position: 1508.5, 101.0, -6187.5
    Health: 20.0 / 20.0
    Is sneaking? false

You can modify player state:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Restore full health
    @var player.setHealth(20.0D)
    # Give 100 experience points
    @var player.giveExp(100)
    # Fill hunger bar
    @var player.setFoodLevel(20)

And access inventory:

.. code-block:: msc

    @define Item hand = player.getItemInMainHand()
    # Check if holding something (AIR means empty hand)
    @if hand.getItemType() != "AIR"
        @player You're holding {{hand.getItemType()}}
    @else
        @player Your hand is empty
    @fi

.. code-block:: output

    You're holding DIAMOND_SWORD

Block
^^^^^

The ``Block`` type represents a block in the world:

.. code-block:: msc

    @define Block b = Block(100, 64, -200, "Theta")
    @player Type: {{b.getBlockType()}}
    @player Light level: {{b.getLightLevel()}}
    @player Is powered? {{b.isBlockPowered()}}

.. code-block:: output

    Type: STONE
    Light level: 0
    Is powered? false

Get blocks relative to another block:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Get the block directly below this one
    @define Block below = block.getRelative(0, -1, 0)
    @if below.isEmpty()
        @player There's nothing below!
    @else
        @player Below: {{below.getBlockType()}}
    @fi

.. code-block:: output

    Below: STONE

Location and Position
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``Location`` represents a precise position with decimal coordinates. ``Position`` adds yaw and pitch for direction:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Get the player's current location
    @define Location loc = player.getLocation()
    @player You are at {{loc.getX()}}, {{loc.getY()}}, {{loc.getZ()}}

    # Get full position including where they're looking
    @define Position pos = player.getPosition()
    @player Facing: yaw={{pos.getYaw()}}, pitch={{pos.getPitch()}}

.. code-block:: output

    You are at 1508.5, 101.0, -6187.5
    Facing: yaw=90.0, pitch=0.0

Convert between location types:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Create a precise location
    @define Location loc = Location(100.7D, 64.3D, 200.2D, "Theta")
    # Convert to block coordinates (floors each component)
    @define BlockLocation blockLoc = loc.asBlockLocation()
    @player Block coordinates: {{blockLoc}}

.. code-block:: output

    Block coordinates: 100 64 200 Theta

Teleport a player using a Position:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Create destination: x, y, z, yaw (90 = west), pitch (0 = level), world
    @define Position destination = Position(100.0D, 64.0D, -200.0D, 90.0, 0.0, "Theta")
    @var player.teleport(destination)
    @player Teleported!

.. code-block:: output

    Teleported!

Region
^^^^^^

The ``Region`` type wraps WorldGuard regions:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Look up an existing WorldGuard region
    @define Region r = Region("spawn", "Alpha")
    @if r.containsPlayer(player)
        @player You are in spawn!
    @else
        @player You are not in spawn.
    @fi

.. code-block:: output

    You are not in spawn.

Create a temporary region for checking bounds:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Define corners of a bounding box
    @define BlockVector3 min = BlockVector3(0, 60, 0)
    @define BlockVector3 max = BlockVector3(100, 80, 100)
    # Create a transient region (not saved to WorldGuard)
    @define Region bounds = Region(min, max, "Theta")
    @if bounds.containsPlayer(player)
        @player You are within the bounds!
    @else
        @player You are outside the bounds.
    @fi

.. code-block:: output

    You are outside the bounds.

User-Defined Types
------------------

While built-in types cover most needs, you can create your own types to organize related data. User-defined types group fields (variables) and methods (functions) into a reusable structure.

.. admonition:: Beginner Note
   :class: beginner-note

   User-defined types are an advanced feature. If you're new to MSC, focus on built-in types first before exploring this section. The rest of this chapter can be revisited when you're more comfortable with MSC scripting and ready to create complex data structures.

Consider a map that tracks player statistics. You might have separate variables for each stat:

.. code-block:: console

    /variable define mymap relative Int deaths = 0
    /variable define mymap relative Int jumps = 0
    /variable define mymap relative Long startTime = 0L

This works, but the variables are loosely connected. A user-defined type bundles them together:

.. code-block:: console

    /type define mymap PlayerStats

Now ``PlayerStats`` is a type that can hold fields and methods, just like ``Player`` or ``Block``.

Creating a Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Types are created with the ``/type define`` command:

.. code-block:: console

    /type define <namespace> <TypeName>

Type names must start with an uppercase letter:

.. code-block:: console

    /type define mymap Coordinate
    /type define mymap PuzzleState
    /type define mymap Timer

Once a type exists, you can add fields, methods, and constructors to it.

Fields
------

Fields are variables that belong to each instance of a type. They store the state of the instance.

Add a field with the ``/type field define`` command:

.. code-block:: console

    /type field define <namespace> <TypeName> <FieldType> <fieldName>

For example, a ``Coordinate`` type might store a position and a label:

.. code-block:: console

    /type field define mymap Coordinate Int x
    /type field define mymap Coordinate Int y
    /type field define mymap Coordinate Int z
    /type field define mymap Coordinate String label

Access fields using dot notation:

.. code-block:: msc

    @using mymap
    # Create a coordinate (assuming constructor is defined)
    @define Coordinate spot = Coordinate(100, 64, -200, "Treasure")
    @player "{{spot.label}}" is at {{spot.x}}, {{spot.y}}, {{spot.z}}

.. code-block:: output

    "Treasure" is at 100, 64, -200

Modify fields the same way:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Update the position and label
    @var spot.x = 150
    @var spot.label = "New Treasure"
    @player Now at {{spot.x}} with label "{{spot.label}}"

.. code-block:: output

    Now at 150 with label "New Treasure"

Each instance has its own copy of each field. Changing one instance does not affect others:

.. code-block:: msc

    @define Coordinate c1 = Coordinate(0, 64, 0, "A")
    @define Coordinate c2 = Coordinate(100, 64, 100, "B")
    # Only c1 is changed
    @var c1.label = "Changed"
    @player c1: {{c1.label}}, c2: {{c2.label}}

.. code-block:: output

    c1: Changed, c2: B

Methods
-------

Methods are functions that operate on instances of a type. They can read and modify the instance's fields, and they have access to the ``this`` keyword.

Define a method with the ``/type method define`` command:

.. code-block:: console

    /type method define <namespace> <TypeName> [ReturnType] <methodName>([parameters])

For example, a method to calculate distance from the coordinate to a player:

.. code-block:: console

    /type method define mymap Coordinate Double distanceTo(Player p)

Then add the method body with the script command:

.. code-block:: console

    /script create method mymap Coordinate distanceTo(Player)

The script might be:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Calculate the difference in each dimension
    @define Double dx = Double(this.x) - p.getX()
    @define Double dy = Double(this.y) - p.getY()
    @define Double dz = Double(this.z) - p.getZ()
    # Return the Euclidean distance
    @return math::sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy + dz*dz)

Now the method can be called on any instance:

.. code-block:: msc

    @define Coordinate goal = Coordinate(100, 64, -200, "Goal")
    @player Distance to goal: {{goal.distanceTo(player)}} blocks

.. code-block:: output

    Distance to goal: 42.5 blocks

Methods without a return type perform actions:

.. code-block:: console

    /type method define mymap Coordinate teleportHere(Player p)

.. code-block:: msc

    # Build a Position from the coordinate's fields
    @define Position pos = Position(Double(this.x), Double(this.y), Double(this.z), 0.0, 0.0, "Theta")
    # Teleport the player
    @var p.teleport(pos)
    @player {{p.getName()}} teleported to "{{this.label}}"!

The ``this`` Keyword
--------------------

Inside a method or constructor, ``this`` refers to the current instance. Use it to access the instance's fields and methods.

Without ``this``, there would be no way for a method to access its own instance's data:

.. code-block:: msc

    @return this.x + this.y + this.z

If a parameter has the same name as a field, ``this`` disambiguates them:

.. code-block:: msc

    @var this.x = x
    @var this.y = y

In this example, ``x`` refers to the parameter, while ``this.x`` refers to the field.

Constructors
------------

Constructors initialize new instances. Without a constructor, fields start at their default values (0 for numbers, ``""`` for strings, ``false`` for booleans, ``null`` for complex types).

Define a constructor with the ``/type constructor define`` command:

.. code-block:: console

    /type constructor define <namespace> <TypeName>([parameters])

For the ``Coordinate`` type:

.. code-block:: console

    /type constructor define mymap Coordinate(Int x, Int y, Int z, String label)

Then add the constructor body:

.. code-block:: console

    /script create constructor mymap Coordinate(Int, Int, Int, String)

.. code-block:: msc

    # Store the parameters in the instance's fields
    @var this.x = x
    @var this.y = y
    @var this.z = z
    @var this.label = label

Now you can create coordinates with initial values:

.. code-block:: msc

    @define Coordinate spawn = Coordinate(100, 64, -200, "Spawn Point")
    @player Created: {{spawn.label}} at {{spawn.x}}, {{spawn.y}}, {{spawn.z}}

.. code-block:: output

    Created: Spawn Point at 100, 64, -200

Multiple Constructors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A type can have multiple constructors with different parameters. This is called *overloading*:

.. code-block:: console

    /type constructor define mymap Coordinate(Int x, Int y, Int z, String label)
    /type constructor define mymap Coordinate(BlockLocation loc, String label)
    /type constructor define mymap Coordinate(String label)

Each constructor has its own body. The third might set default coordinates:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Default to world origin
    @var this.x = 0
    @var this.y = 64
    @var this.z = 0
    @var this.label = label

MSC chooses the constructor based on the arguments provided:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Uses (Int, Int, Int, String) constructor
    @define Coordinate c1 = Coordinate(100, 64, -200, "A")
    # Uses (BlockLocation, String) constructor
    @define Coordinate c2 = Coordinate(block.getLocation(), "B")
    # Uses (String) constructor with defaults
    @define Coordinate c3 = Coordinate("C")
    @player c3 is at {{c3.x}}, {{c3.y}}, {{c3.z}}

.. code-block:: output

    c3 is at 0, 64, 0

Returning from Constructors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. admonition:: Technical Detail
   :class: technical-detail

   Constructors implicitly return the constructed instance. An explicit ``@return`` can be used for constructor chaining, where one constructor calls another. The return value must be the type being constructed.

A constructor can end without a ``@return`` statement. In this case, it returns the instance that was being constructed. If you need to return early or chain to another constructor, use ``@return``:

.. code-block:: msc

    # If no label provided, delegate to another constructor with a default
    @if label == ""
        @return Coordinate(x, y, z, "Unnamed")
    @fi
    # Otherwise initialize normally
    @var this.x = x
    @var this.y = y
    @var this.z = z
    @var this.label = label

Putting It All Together
-----------------------

Here is a complete example of a user-defined type for tracking puzzle progress:

.. code-block:: console

    # Create the type
    /type define mymap PuzzleState

    # Add fields to track progress
    /type field define mymap PuzzleState Int currentStage
    /type field define mymap PuzzleState Boolean[] stagesCompleted
    /type field define mymap PuzzleState Long startTime

    # Add a constructor
    /type constructor define mymap PuzzleState(Int totalStages)

    # Add methods for interacting with the puzzle
    /type method define mymap PuzzleState completeStage(Int stageNum)
    /type method define mymap PuzzleState Boolean isFinished()
    /type method define mymap PuzzleState Int countCompleted()

Constructor body (initializes the state):

.. code-block:: msc

    # Start at stage 0
    @var this.currentStage = 0
    # Create a list of booleans, one per stage, all false
    @var this.stagesCompleted = Boolean[]
    @for Int i in list::range(0, totalStages)
        @var this.stagesCompleted.append(false)
    @done
    # Record when the puzzle was started
    @var this.startTime = system::currentTimeMillis()

The ``completeStage`` method body:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Make sure the stage number is valid
    @if stageNum >= 0 && stageNum < this.stagesCompleted.length()
        # Mark this stage as done
        @var this.stagesCompleted[stageNum] = true
        # Advance current stage if needed
        @if stageNum >= this.currentStage
            @var this.currentStage = stageNum + 1
        @fi
    @fi

The ``isFinished`` method body:

.. code-block:: msc

    # Check if any stage is still incomplete
    @for Boolean done in this.stagesCompleted
        @if !done
            @return false
        @fi
    @done
    # All stages complete!
    @return true

The ``countCompleted`` method body:

.. code-block:: msc

    @define Int count = 0
    @for Boolean done in this.stagesCompleted
        @if done
            @var count = count + 1
        @fi
    @done
    @return count

Using the type in a script:
